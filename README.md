# Project Title :"DeepVerify360: Guardian of Truth in Video Realms" -Deepfake Detection with TensorFlow

This project aims to detect deepfake videos using TensorFlow and Keras. It utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze video frames and classify them as real or fake.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Mount Google Drive to access the dataset.
4. Run the provided code in a Google colab or Python script.

## Folder Structure

- `deepfake_detection.ipynb`: Google colab containing the main code.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all the dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.
- `deepfake_model.h5`: Saved model file containing the trained deepfake detection model.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset, including training and test videos.

## Usage

1. Mount Google Drive to access the dataset stored in the `data/` folder.
2. Run the provided code in the Google colab `deepfake_detection.ipynb`.
3. Follow the instructions to train the deepfake detection model and evaluate its performance.

## Results

- Trained the deepfake detection model with an accuracy of 80% on the test set.
- Visualized the predictions on sample videos, achieving high detection accuracy.
